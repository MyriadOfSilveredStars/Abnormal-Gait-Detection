Detecting and Correcting Abnormal Gaits with Music

Third Year Project by Rho Bates

Project Supervisor: Dr Jacob Newman

Contact: tyb23mnu@uea.ac.uk

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that is capable to analysing human gait patterns and classify them as either 'normal' or 'abnormal'. After classifying abnormal gaits, the system should then recommend audio or haptic based rhythmic corrections to help people focus on performing normal gaits. 

Last Update: made a new machine that works iteratively to find the average accuracy

For Next Time: 
- change each datapoint to contain both the average of that gait type and that datapoint's standard deviation.
