Detecting and Correcting Abnormal Gaits with Music

Third Year Project by Rho Bates

Project Supervisor: Dr Jacob Newman

Contact: tyb23mnu@uea.ac.uk

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that is capable to analysing human gait patterns and classify them as either 'normal' or 'abnormal'. After classifying abnormal gaits, the system should then recommend audio or haptic based rhythmic corrections to help people focus on performing normal gaits. 

Last Update: added all the code so far onto GitHub.

For Next Time: 
- change each datapoint to contain both the average of that gait type and that datapoint's standard deviation. 
- try the 9-and-1 method, where you train and test an algorithm iteratively using each one of the datafiles as a test each time. Combine and find the average of the accuracy scores.
- print and save a graphical representation of each datafile, right before it is put through the machine, to ensure there are no anomalies such as missing data
